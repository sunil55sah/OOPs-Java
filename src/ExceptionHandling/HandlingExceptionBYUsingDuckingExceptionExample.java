/*
 * Real Life Analogy:
Imagine a bank employee (method) finds an error in the transaction,
 but instead of solving it himself, he passes the problem to the manager (caller).
  The manager then handles it and informs the customer.
That's ducking â€” not solving it yourself but passing it to someone else to handle.
